1. Key purpose: exposing myself outwardly. Putting myself out there into the world
	- When my internal vision/version of the world matches my outward reality, that is when I will be happy. 
	- Ofc the only way to achieve this is by putting myself out there
	- key is to cultivate a growth mindset, a beginner's mind(초심), which is about being curious and open-minded
	- Everyone has a beginning. We all need to start somewhere
	- The beginner segment is great because everyone is a beginner at something. Our target market is for the beginners of everything. Wines, high end audio gear, scuba diving etc
	- In my profile, share a blurb from the Japanese zen book "Shoushin"
	- 초심이란 열정이다

		1. That sb not funny, not over the top, nerdy, obsessed with productivity could be a youtuber
	3. Post carousel type content with actionable soundbites from the podcasts I listen to (possibly IG would be better platform for this)
	4. Also share Snippets from podcasts around the world. There has to be loads of famous people on pidcasts around the world. Assemble a team that can translate these for us to post on IG
	5. I'm in love with the idea...without doing the actual work. Because anything is possible in your head. Stop watching gaming youtubers and entrepreneur success stories. The real value is in the work. I find myself gravitating towards the passionate types on YouTube because I feel like I once had that kind of passion...for languages, etc.
	6. Finding a job overseas. Be vulnerable and honestly showcase where I am applying.
