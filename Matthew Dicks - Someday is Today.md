## Intro

## Rating

### Entertainment
3.5/5. Not a conventionally "fun" page-turner of a book, but loved his example stories because they are plain and mundane. As I am someone interested in other people's productivity habits, it was fun getting a chance to peer into his life and how he gets more done.

### Resonance
3.5/5. Again, his no nonsense style of writing, his frank admission of the realistic contraints of parenting, and his attitude of approaching his endeavors with a matter-of-fact mind made his style very grounded and relatable.
### Originality
3/5. His ideas weren't in and of themselves that original or novel. What differed was his delivery and lived-in original life examples and stories that made his ideas believable and had me rooting for him.

### Coherence

### Recommendability


## 3-sentence summary
3-time near death survivor and storyteller extraordinaire's no nonsense guide to stop your excuses and do more of what you need to get done. Filled with short sentences in a conversational style that is very easy to read, and dispenses advice that is borne out by the author's own experimentation and experience. Loved the fact that it is very grounded and contrarian.

## Verbatim
